# Typed References

Typed references are strongly typed wrappers over raw identifiers like `ActorId` and `PortId`. These types are used throughout hyperactor’s APIs; as parameters in messages, return values from `bind()` methods, and elements in routing decisions. They make distributed communication safe, expressive, and statically checked.

## Overview

There are three main typed reference types:

- [`ActorRef<A>`](#actorrefa): A typed reference to an actor implementing the `Referable` trait.
- [`PortRef<M>`](#portrefm): A reference to a reusable mailbox port for messages of type `M` implementing the `RemoteMessage` trait.
- [`OncePortRef<M>`](#onceportrefm): A reference to a one-shot port for receiving a single response of type `M` implementing the `RemoteMessage` trait.

These types are used as parameters in messages, return values from bindings, and components of the routing system.

## `ActorRef<A>`

`ActorRef<A>` is a typed reference to an actor of type `A`. It provides a way to identify and address remote actors that implement `Referable`.

```rust
let actor_ref: ActorRef<MyActor> = ActorRef::attest(actor_id);
```

> **Note**: While `ActorRef::attest` can be used to construct a reference from an `ActorId`, it should generally be avoided. Instead, prefer using the `ActorRef` returned from `ActorHandle::bind()`, which guarantees that the actor is actually running and bound to a mailbox. `attest` is unsafe in the sense that it bypasses that guarantee.

Unlike `ActorHandle<A>`, an `ActorRef` is just a reference — it doesn’t guarantee that the actor is currently running. It's primarily used for routing and type-safe messaging across `Proc`s.

### Definition
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ActorRef<A: Referable> {
    actor_id: ActorId,
    phantom: PhantomData<A>,
}
```
This type is a thin wrapper around an `ActorId`, with a phantom type `A` to track which actor it refers to. It ensures you can only send messages supported by the actor's declared `RemoteHandles`.

## `PortRef<M>`

`PortRef<M>` refers to a mailbox port for messages of type `M`.
```rust
let (port, mut receiver) = actor.open_port::<MyMessage>();
let port_ref: PortRef<MyMessage> = port.bind();
```

This allows the port to be sent across the network or passed into other messages. On the receiving end, `PortRef` can be used to deliver messages of the expected type.

### Definition

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct PortRef<M: RemoteMessage> {
    port_id: PortId,
    reducer_spec: Option<ReducerSpec>,
    phantom: PhantomData<M>,
}
```
As with `ActorRef`, this is a typed wrapper around a raw identifier (`PortId`), carrying a phantom type for safety. It ensures that only messages of type `M` can be sent through this reference.

## `OncePortRef<M>`

A `OncePortRef<M>` is like a `PortRef`, but designed for exactly one response. Once used, it cannot be reused or cloned.
```rust
let (once_port, receiver) = actor.open_once_port::<MyMessage>();
let once_ref = once_port.bind();
```
These are commonly used for request/response interactions, where a single reply is expected.

### Definition

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct OncePortRef<M: Message> {
    port_id: PortId,
    phantom: PhantomData<M>,
}
```
Just like `PortRef`, this wraps a `PortId` with a phantom message type `M` for type safety. Internally, the system enforces one-time delivery semantics, ensuring the port is closed after receiving a single message.

## `GangRef<A>`

A `GangRef<A>` is a typed reference to a gang of actors, all of which implement the same `Referable` type `A`.
```rust
let gang_ref: GangRef<MyActor> = GangId::new(...).into();
```
You can extract an `ActorRef<A>` for a specific rank in the gang:
```rust
let actor = gang_ref.rank(0); // ActorRef<MyActor>
```
This allows you to route messages to specific members of a replicated actor group, or to iterate over the gang for broadcasting, synchronization, or indexing.

### Definition
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Hash, Ord)]
pub struct GangRef<A: Referable> {
    gang_id: GangId,
    phantom: PhantomData<A>,
}
```

#### Methods
- `gang_ref.rank(rank: usize) -> ActorRef<A>`
Returns a typed actor reference for the actor at the given rank in the gang. The method doesn’t validate the rank, so correctness is up to the caller.
- `gang_ref.gang_id() -> &GangId`
Returns the underlying, untyped gang identifier.
