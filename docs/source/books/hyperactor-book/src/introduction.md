# Hyperactor

This book describes the design and implementation of the hyperactor runtime.

The goal is to provide a clear, structured explanation of how actors communicate safely and efficiently across distributed systems using hyperactorâ€™s abstractions.

We hope this becomes the book we wish we had when we started working with Monarch. Work in progress.
