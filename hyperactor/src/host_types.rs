//! Types shared across host-related modules.
//!
//! This module centralizes supporting types and errors used by
//! [`Host`](crate::host::Host) and its
//! [`ProcManager`](crate::proc_manager::ProcManager) implementations.
//!
//! Currently includes:
//! - [`HostError`] â€” the error type for host and proc manager
//!   operations.
//!
//! Over time, additional host-scoped types (proc status, handles,
//! etc.) may live here as the process manager lifecycle evolves.

use crate::ProcId;
use crate::channel::ChannelError;

/// The type of error produced by host operations.
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]

    /// A channel error occurred during a host operation.
