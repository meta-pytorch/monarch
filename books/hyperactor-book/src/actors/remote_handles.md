# RemoteHandles

The `RemoteHandles<M>` trait is a marker used to declare that a given `RemoteActor` type can handle messages of type `M`.
```rust
pub trait RemoteHandles<M: RemoteMessage>: RemoteActor {}
```

An implementation like:
```rust
impl RemoteHandles<ShoppingList> for ShoppingListActor {}
```
means that `ShoppingListActor` is known to handle the `ShoppingList` message type.

These implementations are typically generated by the `#[export(handlers = [...])]` macro, and are not written by hand.
