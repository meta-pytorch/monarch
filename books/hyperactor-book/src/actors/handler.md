# The `Handler` Trait

The `Handler` trait defines how an actor receives and responds to messages of a specific type.

Each message type that an actor can handle must be declared by implementing this trait. The runtime invokes the `handle` method when such a message is delivered.

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Handler<M>: Actor {
    async fn handle(&mut self, this: &Context<Self>, message: M) -> Result<(), anyhow::Error>;
}
```

## Message Dispatch: `handle`

The `handle` method is invoked by the runtime whenever a message of type `M` arrives at a matching port on the actor.
- message is the received payload.
- this gives access to the actor's runtime context, including its identity, mailbox, and and any capabilities exposed by the `Instance` type (such as spawning or reference resolution).
- The return value indicates whether the message was handled successfully.

An actor may implement `Handler<M>` multiple times — once for each message type `M` it supports.

## Built-in Handlers

The runtime provides implementations of `Handler<M>` for a few internal message types:

### `Handler<Signal>`

This is a marker implementation indicating that all actors can receive `Signal`. The handler is not expected to be invoked directly — its real behavior is implemented inside the runtime.
```rust
#[async_trait]
impl<A: Actor> Handler<Signal> for A {
    async fn handle(
        &mut self,
        _this: &Context<Self>,
        _message: Signal,
    ) -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
        unimplemented!("signal handler should not be called directly")
    }
}
```

### `Handler<Undeliverable<MessageEnvelope>>`

```rust
#[async_trait]
impl<A, M> Handler<IndexedErasedUnbound<M>> for A
where
    A: Handler<M>,
    M: Castable,
{
    async fn handle(
        &mut self,
        this: &Context<Self>,
        msg: IndexedErasedUnbound<M>,
    ) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
        let message = msg.downcast()?.bind()?;
        Handler::handle(self, this, message).await
    }
}
```
This implementation allows an actor to transparently handle erased, rebound messages of type `M`, provided it already implements `Handler<M>`.

This construct is used in the implementation of **accumulation**, a communication pattern where a message is multicast to multiple recipients and their replies are gathered—possibly through intermediate actors—before being sent back to the original sender.

To enable this, messages are unbound at the sender: reply ports (`PortRef`s) are extracted into a `Bindings` object, allowing intermediate nodes to rewrite those ports to point back to themselves. This ensures that replies from downstream actors are routed through the intermediate, enabling reply collection and reduction.

Once a message reaches its destination, it is rebound by merging the updated bindings back into the message. The `Handler<IndexedErasedUnbound<M>>` implementation automates this by recovering the typed message `M` and dispatching it to the actor's existing `Handler<M>` implementation.

This allows actors to remain unaware of accumulation mechanics—they can just implement `Handler<M>` as usual.
