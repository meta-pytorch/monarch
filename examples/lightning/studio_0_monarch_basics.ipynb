   "source": "# Studio 0: Monarch Basics - Ping Pong Tutorial\n\nWelcome to the Lightning Studios Monarch series! This is **Studio 0**, where you'll learn the fundamentals of Monarch's Actor API through simple, hands-on examples.\n\n## What is Monarch?\n\n**Monarch** is Meta's distributed actor framework for building scalable, distributed applications. It makes it easy to:\n- Run code across multiple processes or machines\n- Coordinate distributed computations\n- Build complex distributed systems with simple Python code\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn:\n1. **Core Concepts**: Actors, Endpoints, and Process Meshes\n2. **Hello World**: Creating and calling actors\n3. **Calling Patterns**: Broadcasting vs. targeting specific actors\n4. **Actor Communication**: How actors talk to each other (Ping Pong!)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Basic Python knowledge\n- Understanding of `async`/`await` (we'll provide a quick refresher)\n- Monarch installed (see [installation guide](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/monarch))\n\n## Lightning Studios Learning Path\n\nThis is the **foundation** studio. After completing this, you can progress to:\n\n- **[Studio 1: Getting Started](./studio_1_getting_started.ipynb)** - Multi-node training with Lightning\n- **[Studio 2: Workspace Sync](./studio_2_workspace_sync.ipynb)** - Hot-reload configs without restarting\n- **[Studio 3: Interactive Debugging](./studio_3_interactive_debugging.ipynb)** - Debug distributed systems\n\nLet's dive in! 🚀"

    "## What is an Actor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an **Actor** as an independent worker that:\n",
    "- Has its own state (variables)\n",
    "- Runs in its own process (possibly on a different machine)\n",
    "- Exposes **endpoints** (methods) that can be called remotely\n",

Head to **[Studio 1](./studio_1_getting_started.ipynb)** next!\n\nHappy coding with Monarch! 🎊"
