"""
Monarch Actor API: Ping Pong Example
====================================

This example demonstrates the basics of Monarch's Actor/endpoint API, which provides
a generic interface for distributed computing. We'll cover:

- Creating and spawning actors in process meshes
- Calling endpoints on actors
- Actor-to-actor communication with a ping-pong example
"""

# %%
# Hello World
# -----------
# Actors are spawned in Process meshes via the `monarch.actor` API. For those familiar with 
# distributed systems, it can be helpful to think of each Actor as a server with endpoints 
# that can be called.
